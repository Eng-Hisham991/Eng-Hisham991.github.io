## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this homework a visualization dashboard website created using visualizations 
which created in a past assignment. Specifically, weather data would be plotted
(Resources/cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, individual pages were created for each plot and a means 
by which navigate can be between them. These pages contained the visualizations 
and their corresponding explanations. This work also has a landing page, a page where 
a comparison of all of the plots can be seen, and another page where the 
data used to build them can be viewed.

### Website Requirements

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

* A landing page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Four visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A Comparisons page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so it can be easily 
compared them visually.
  * Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
    * The grid has be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 
    1 across on extra-small and small screens.
* A Data page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    * The table is a bootstrap table component. 
    * The data comes from the `.csv` file which was converted to HTML. 

The website, at the top of every page, has a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the 
  landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links 
  to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons 
  page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries). 

Finally, the website deployed to GitHub pages.
